4. Chronological Professional Experience & Projects
Phase 1: Infrastructure & Energy (Late 2023)
Role: Field Engineering Intern (Solar Installation)
Organization: Eauxwell Nigeria Limited
Period: Nov 2023 – Dec 2023
Samuel’s entry into large-scale infrastructure began with renewable energy. He supported the installation of a 3MW Hybrid Solar Power Plant at FUNAAB.
* Key Achievement: Ensured strict adherence to HSE standards, earning HSE Levels 1 & 2 Certification from UNICUS Nigeria.
* Operational Scope: Equipment calibration, documentation of field inspection reports, and maintenance of hybrid systems.
Phase 2: Automotive Engineering & Diagnostics (2024)
Role: Mechanical, Electrical, and Automobile Engineering Intern
Organization: Automedics Engineering Limited
Period: Apr 2024 – Oct 2024
Transitioning to automotive systems, Samuel combined field operations with rigorous diagnostics training.
* Routine: His schedule involved 8:00 AM workshop sanitation and reporting, followed by specialized diagnostic classes (Mon/Wed/Fri) focusing on electronic control systems and transmission technologies.
* Notable Technical Repairs:
   * Toyota Hilux: Executed full-day clutch disc replacements.
   * Honda Pilot: Performed torque converter replacements, identifying mechanical degradation in worn shafts.
   * Fleet Maintenance: Assisted in the diagnostics and system testing of light and fleet vehicles using modern electronic tools.
Phase 3: Embedded Systems Research (Early 2025)
Project: Smart Water Purification System
Context: Academic Capstone / Research
Period: Jan 2025 – June 2025
Samuel led the engineering of an automated water quality monitoring system addressing SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).
* System Architecture: Integrated an ESP32 microcontroller with a sensor array (TDS, pH, Turbidity, Flow, Pressure) and actuators (Solenoid valves, UV lamps).
* Functionality: The system provided real-time automated purification and transmitted data to a Blynk server for remote monitoring.
* Outcome: Despite a battery failure during the final demo, Samuel produced a technical handover report recommending a migration from procedural logic to AI-based predictive maintenance, creating a foundation for future publication in NIJOTECH.
Phase 4: AI Innovation & Governance (Late 2025 – Present)
Role: Gen AI Fellow
Organization: Ogun State Government / Bosun Tijani Foundation
Period: Aug 2025 – Current
Currently, Samuel leverages AI to solve governance challenges. He collaborates with cross-disciplinary teams to prototype AI solutions for social inclusion and economic growth.
Key Project: AGROUSSD (Sept 2025 – Current)
* Concept: An AI-powered agritech platform bridging financial and data gaps for rural smallholder farmers via USSD.
* Impact Metrics: Engaged 100+ student farmers and 3 commercial farmers in prototype testing.
* SDG Alignment: Contributes to Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and No Poverty (SDG 1) by providing real-time market data.
* Leadership: Manages a volunteer team of 4 developers to refine the USSD architecture.
Phase 5: Civic Technology & RAG Development (Jan 2026)
Project: CivicAccess (Team SabiLaw)
Achievement: 1st Place Winner, Awarri N-Atlas Hackathon
Period: Dec 2025 – Jan 2026
Samuel led "Team Sabilaw" to victory by developing CivicAccess, a multi-lingual Legal First Responder.
* Technical Implementation: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that interprets the Nigerian Constitution and Tenancy Laws into plain English, Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba.
* Role: Directed the product roadmap and coordinated sprint planning for a team of 5, ensuring delivery of a functioning prototype within a 5-day deadline.
* Trajectory: This project marks a definitive shift toward high-stakes, real-world AI deployment for social justice (SDG 16).
5. Leadership & Community Impact
* Student Union Executive (2024–2025): Managed the annual budget for the Umar Kabir Hall of Residence (2000+ students), ensuring 100% financial transparency. Secured partnerships with Monster Energy and Moniepoint for student welfare events.
* Academic Mentorship (2021–Present): Organized peer-to-peer tutorials for over 150 students in Engineering Mathematics and Fluid Flow, significantly improving department pass rates.
* Technical Volunteer: Provided free IT support and hardware repair (OS installation, component replacement) for peers, reducing technical downtime and costs for the student community.
6. Current Technical Trajectory & Future Goals
As of early 2026, Samuel is actively refining his digital portfolio by converting his static website into a dynamic Django-based application featuring a custom RAG component. He is simultaneously pursuing advanced research opportunities, specifically targeting the SMACCS and EMSHIP scholarship programs to further specialize in autonomous systems and smart infrastructure.
